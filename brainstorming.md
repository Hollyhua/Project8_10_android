A file discussion our app ideas
the ideas that we've come up with are:
1. color search 
2. coffeeAPI 
3. Pokemon card generator

Color search:
This ap would have a editVeiw and an imageView for the user it enter a color name and have it displayed on the imageView. 
The app is simple enough but can be done without an API.

CoffeeAPI:
This app would display use and editView and a imageView along with an API to display a pcture of a type of coffe searched for in the editView.
An Api with all the coffee types would be nessasary for this project

Pokemon Card Generator:
This app would use and imageView and an editView to create a digital Pokemon trading card with an Pokemon API enabled.

The app we have chosen is:
CoffeeAPI
